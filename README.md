# Real-time-log-analysis-with-Spark-streaming-and-Kafka
Launch an EC2 instance on AWS and install Docker in it with tools like Apache Spark, Apache NiFi, Apache Kafka, Jupyter Lab, Plotly and Dash. Then, perform preprocessing on sample data, parse it into individual columns, cleaning the data and formatting timestamp. The "NASA access log dataset" is extracted by using Apache NiFi and Apache Kafka, followed by Transformation and Load using Cassandra and HDFS and finally Visualizing it using Python Plotly and Dash
